# Malaria-Cells-Classification
Cell images of parasitized and uninfected cells from thin blood smear slide images of segmented cells.

The Malaria-Cell-Classifier notebook contains the code that is used to create a model which is able to classify whether a blood smear is uninfected or parasitized.
Tha dataset used is from the Tensorflow Image libraries, which contains approximately 27,500 cell images of parasitized and uninfected cells from thin blood smear slide images of segmented cells.

The Notebook can be accesses in Kaggle via the link: [Malaria-Cell-Classifier](https://www.kaggle.com/code/jothammasila/malaria-cell-classifier/edit). 

The trained model can be accessed or downloaded via the link: [malaria_cell_model.h5](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CL08QS4vqxohc-DhGMzEVDLyhuZsf0CX/view?usp=sharing)
Then store the downloased model in the right folder and then load and try it using the code in the [Loading Saved Model](https://www.kaggle.com/code/jothammasila/malaria-cell-classifier/edit) part of the original notebook.
