# Malaria-Cells-Classification
Cell images of parasitized and uninfected cells from thin blood smear slide images of segmented cells.

The # Malaria-Cell-Classifier notebook contains the code that is used to create a model which is able to classify whether a blood smear is uninfected or parasitized.
Tha dataset used is from the Tensorflow Image libraries, which contains approximately 27,500 cell images of parasitized and uninfected cells from thin blood smear slide images of segmented cells.
The Notebook can be accesses in Kaggle via the link: [Malaria-Cell-Classifier](https://www.kaggle.com/code/jothammasila/malaria-cell-classifier/edit).
